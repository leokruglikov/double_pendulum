# double_pendulum
Simulation of a double pendulum and visualization with gnuplot animation

#Description
This C++ programm was written back in 2019. The aim of the programm was to simulate a double pendulum by solving a system of differential equations with 4th order Runge-Kutta method. The data was collected in a simple .dat file and the animation was made with gnuplot - a plotting programm written in C.
